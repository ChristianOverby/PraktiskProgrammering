largest signed int number: 2147483647
largest signed int number + 1:  -2147483648  This is also the smallest number due to the overflow wrap
largest signed int number + 10: -2147483639
+1 larger or smaller? larger
largest unsigned int number: 4294967295
largest unsigned int number + 1:  0
largest unsigned int number + 10: 9
+1 larger or smaller? smaller

I cannot explain the expressions with any security, i feel that the "tiny" epsilon should just be rounded to 0
It seems as though the tiny epsilon can be added together as long as one is in the domain of their size
d1: 8
d2: 8
d1 == d2: true
